# Data Analytics Portfolio
## Introduction
Hi, I’m Geoffrey Rwamakuba — 
I’m an analyst at a boutique investment bank, with experience supporting complex financing transactions and delivering data-driven insights. 
I’ve assisted in the successful closing of **£400m+ in debt financing transactions**, working across financial modelling, analysis, and deal execution.
Alongside my professional role, I've built data projects showcasing my ability to work with Python, SQL, and Tableau — from data cleaning and analysis to visualiaation and insight generation.
